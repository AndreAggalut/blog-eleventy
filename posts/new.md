# What did I work on this week

- I determined some of the possible entities that can be part of our database design.

- This week, I worked on finding the API key for the weather application(Dark Sky) that we are planning to implement on our web application.

- Documented the content that can go to our About Me page

# What did I learn

<b>Axios</b>

- is promised-base
- can use the same API from node.js

# What was difficult

- understanding how to implement the API to our project
- figuring out what to use between fetch or axios

# What was effective / ineffective about both your personal and your group work flow?

- Our communication is effective
- My knowledge from database can be applied to the project
-

# Any additional thoughts on your product

- Our project is bound to make a change in the web surfing
