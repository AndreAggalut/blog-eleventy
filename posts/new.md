# What did I work on this week

- I determined some of the possible entities that can be part of our database design.

- This week, I worked on finding the API key for the weather application(Dark Sky) that we are planning to implement on our web application.

- Documented the content that can go to our About Me page

# What did I learn

<b>Axios</b>

- is promised-base
- can use the same API from node.js
- can send objects compared to fetch

<b> Git </b>

- Master branch vs Production branch
- You can the roll the command back

# What was difficult

- Understanding how to implement the API to our project
- Figuring out what to use between fetch or axios

# What was effective / ineffective about both your personal and your group work flow?

- Our communication is effective
- Applying my knowledge from database, and how can it be applied to the project

# Any additional thoughts on your product

- Our project is bound to make a change in the web surfing world
